Design a fully responsive, production-ready email template using the React Email library (@react-email on npm).
The email should adhere to modern, minimalist design principles.
The template should be structured using React components and should not rely on additional UI libraries or frameworks unless explicitly requested.
Use valid image URLs from sources like Unsplash, do not embed the images.
You can review the example.tsx file, which represents the email template. Make your changes directly to the example.tsx file based on the requirements.
Test and verify that the image URLs are functional and accessible.
