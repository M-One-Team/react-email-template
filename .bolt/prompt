Design a fully responsive, production-ready email template using the React Email library (@react-email on npm). The email should adhere to modern, minimalist design principles and be styled with Tailwind CSS. Use only the React Email library for structure and styling, without any additional UI libraries or frameworks unless explicitly requested.
Additionally, include an example .tsx file in the email template's folder, demonstrating how the email template can be structured using React components.
